# trafficSim
As a professional, traffic simulation software is only intoxicated with the use of VISSIM to see the effect of 3D simulation, it is not enough. There is no intention to criticize a particular software, but the function of commercial software for micro traffic modeling is almost no (I mean, let you set up your own driver model, build your own rules, build your own traffic rules, build your own traffic control rules, build your own Barbara, fundamentally, and not just It is a few incomprehensible parameters to modify the built-in models of commercial software. So, why don't you develop one yourself? Look at the following link for more information

The simulation software (where to go?)
1, in order to provide a good learning and experimental platform for researchers in the field of transportation, it can produce a certain academic value. For those who have the ability to have the energy and ambition to explore traffic simulation, hope is a help, after all, I have explored these paths. Remove a certain base of professionals, to develop a preliminary obstacle to their own simulation software, to provide a once practiced ideas and ideas.

2, reduce the threshold of practice and give full play to the academic value.

After all, there is a basic platform. In a few months, you can improve or practice your own model on this platform. The platform allows itself to build a model, and then run out of the software to see the simulation animation, analyze and analyze the simulation data, and solve the limitations of the model.

To solve the limitation of software
Academic researchers can improve their software and deepen their understanding of traffic simulation according to their needs.
